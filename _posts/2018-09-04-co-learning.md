Today's Co-Learning we had a full table in the Toni-Areal's main hall...

Here, an extract of what we did:

ale & cc: had a quick look at passing values by reference and at templates:
- yes, there are ways to create a proof of concept where a reference points to a variable that got out of scope
- templates are easy when the example is short.

we also looked at some of cc's source code and discusded refactoring ideas

Nathan:
- learn't more basics in Python (intergers, floating numbers, operations etc.)

Richard and Luca:
- Enhanced the MongoDB C++ application to read from the database

Francesco:
- looking into adding to my graphic-engine support to render to macos window toolkit **failed!** will try again wih qt or electron.

Arthur:
- Started writing a summary of the syntax of the Swift programming language
